The project is about letting the use enter a url and then the content is fetched and shown on the UI.

There is a TypeScript Svelte-Kit under src/ that was copied over from a pretty much unrelated project when it comes to functionality but it had the technology i need in my new project.

Under src_fin/ there is another older application. There i started to do what is my current project from a functional perspective.

Now I want to do it in svelte-kit in the src/ directory.


Only make edits/additions under src/
Only make changes/additions in the new code.
When creating new files they have to be svelte-kit typescript files.
Use namings from the new project and not from the old.
