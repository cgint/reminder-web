## How to develop
Use a combination of `npm-watch` (rebuild to dist-directory) and `wrangler --live-reload` (update on change in dist-directory) to realise auto-reload.

```
Terminal1: npm run watch
Terminal2: npm run preview
```

or simply use the script `preview_watch.sh` to manage both processes.
